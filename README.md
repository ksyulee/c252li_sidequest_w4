## Description

This sketch demonstrates how a 2D array represents a maze/game level.

## After my edits
I added a little blob that travels through the array. You(the player) can manipuate it by using arrow keys on the keyboard. In the game you can also lose if you run into the red obstacles

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Nested loops to iterate through grid rows/columns
- Converting grid coordinates (r,c) → screen coordinates (x,y)
- Tile-based rendering (every cell = one rectangle)

- Learned how to edit arrays
- how to use GenAI productively

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.

The updated code was written with the help of GenAI. Edited placement of obstacles myself
